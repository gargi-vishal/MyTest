Notes on Chapter 1
=====================
Flexible vs Inflexible models:
---------------------------------------
Suppose we have a set of observations (or predictors) and we come up with a model that goes through every single one of these observations (like a very squiggly curve) 
then that would be considered a very flexible model. But would be plagued with overfitting.

But if we just draw a straight line some place in the middle of these observations (linear regression), then further predictions would also only lie on this line. So this is considered inflexible. 

Bias Variance trade-off:
